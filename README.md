## C++ L2 Challenge

This repo contains a solution to the CPP L2 challenge that proposed to reimplement a C++11 standard library container. The *std::vector* container was chosen for reimplementation.

The code can be found in the *include* folder, in header only form, along with test cases for it in the *test* folder.
